# Ovid's *Tristia* and *Epistulae ex Ponto*

The *Tristia* are a collection of 50 elegies in 5 books written by Ovid between 9-13 CE, during his exile in the town of Tomis (modern-day Constantia in Romania). This collection is mainly dadicated to the poet's excruciating lament over his unfortunate condition and the incessant appeal to his friends and wife for salvation.

The *Epistulae ex Ponto* are a collection of 46 letters in elegiac couplets divided into 4 books. Started in 12 CE and written until the poet's death in 17 CE, these verse-epistles carefully depict the landscape and culture of the Dobruja and record the poet's extreme attempt to find new powerful patrons willing to recall him back to Rome.

For both works, the digital text is taken from [The Latin Library](http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/ovid.html). The original text was lemmatized and PoS tagged with the [LiLa Text Linker](https://lila-erc.eu/LiLaTextLinker/). Moreover, the tool performed the linking of the text to the Lemma Bank of the [LiLa Knowledge Base](https://lila-erc.eu). The output of the Text Linker was checked and corrected manually at the CIRCSE Research Centre of the UniversitÃ  Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Milan, Italy.

The following lines, which were omitted by mistake in the original source, were added following Wheeler's edition (cit.):
> tollere, conantes dura coercet hiems, (Tr. 3.10.44)

> siue redundatas flumine cogit aquas, (Tr. 3.10.52)

> cum fugerem merito naufragus omne fretum,>> (Tr. 5.12.50)

The standardization of capitalization usage and the adoption of the "u" character even for the voiced labiodental fricative [v] were applied to both texts, following the convention adopted in the LiLa Lemma Bank.
